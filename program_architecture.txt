The uNav board is designed with one dsPIC33FJ64MC804 to both control the
motors and perform navigation.
The program is fully interrupt driven.
After the initializations, the program enters in a "no-code" Main loop.
Every action is started via Interrupt Service Routines triggered by interrupts.
The dsPIC33F has 44 interrupt vectors used by the peripherals and 8 reserved to
the system.
Some interrupts are managed directly by the hardware peripherals or through the
DMA, other are used as "soft interrupts" triggered by the code.
In this way it's possible to define the priority for each function, even
dinamically, optimizing the resources at most. A slow procedure can be
interrupted by time-critical one performing a true real-time behavior.

Let's analyzing in detail the ISRs
Peripheral interrupts
- Input Capture 1 and 2 used to obtain the speed
- Timer 1 overflow used as the time scheduler for all the timed procedures
- Timer 2 overflow used, together with IC1 and IC2, to measure the encoder ticks
- UART1 RX for incoming communication
- DMA0 used by the ADC to measure the motor current
- DMA1 used by UART TX

Soft interrupts
- OC1 triggers the speed measurement and PIDs control
- OC2 triggers the incoming communication packets parsing
- RTC triggers the dead-reckoning procedures
